# student-roster-cpp
Student roster project using C++

You've been contracted to assist the university with this transition. Your task is to implement a portion of the system based on provided requirements. The project involves developing a program with five classes: Student, SecurityStudent, NetworkStudent, SoftwareStudent, and Roster. These classes will manage student data within a course, including information like student ID, name, email, age, and course completion days.

The program will read a list of five students and manipulate their data using function calls. It will also create student objects based on their degree program while parsing the data list. The goal is to ensure smooth migration and accurate management of student information. Overall, it's a hands-on project involving C++ programming to streamline university operations and enhance efficiency in student data management.
